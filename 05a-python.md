###Q1. Lists &amp; Tuples

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?

Question Status: In progress
>> Python Lists are different 


>> Python Lists & Tuples: Similarities

>> Python Lists & Tuples: Differences
- Mutability: Lists are mutable; Tuples are not. 
- Heteogenity/Homoegenity of objects: Generally lists work better for objects of the same type (although it's not forced by), whereas tuples are more for heterogenous objects.
- Structured vs. Unstructured - Tuples have structure, whereas lists of have order. As a consequence of tuples being designed for different types of objects, the position of each type of object creates a specific structure.
