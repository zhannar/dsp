*Exercise 2: Suppose you draw a sample with size n=10 from an exponential distribution with Î»=2. Simulate this experiment 1000 times and plot the sampling distribution of the estimate L.*

*Compute the standard error of the estimate and the 90% confidence interval.*

*Repeat the experiment with a few different values of n and make a plot of standard error versus n.*
