[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

*The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?*


### A. Communicate the problem: 

This problem serves to show the conceptual similarity between drawing numbers 'randomly' and drawing numbers from the uniform distribution. 


### B. How you solved it: 

I solved this problem by generating 1000 numbers and plotting their Probability Mass Function (PMF) and a Cumulative Density Function (CDF) 

### C. Solution 

Were the random number function actually generating numbers randomly, their PMF and CDF should allign closely to that of the uniform distribution. That is, the PMF should be a horizontal line and the CDF should be a 45 degree diagonal line. As is shown by the diagrams, the numbers are fairly closely alligned to that of the uniform distribution. 

In the PMF, all or most of the numbers appear to have a probability of 0.001 of being selected. This is to be expected as the total probability must equal to 1, and 1/1000 = 0.001. Likewise, in the CDF, the numbers closely allign to the 45 degree line which was predicted from the uniform distribution. 

**As a caveat, the uniform distribution is traditionally continuous and so the probability of any single number is actually 0, but for discrete cases, as this is meant to be a parallel for, then all outcomes should have an equal probability and thus be one divided by the total number of outcomes.*

### D. The Details:


##### Step 1: Import the required datasets.
```
import random
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot
```

##### Step 2: Generate the 1000 numbers.

```
rand_numbers = []
for i in range(0,1000):
    print i
    x = random.random()
    rand_numbers.append(x)
```

##### Step 3: Show the PMF.

```
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand_numbers)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Show()
```

##### Step 4: Show the CDF.

```
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand_numbers)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show()
```
